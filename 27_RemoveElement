Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

Hint:

Try two pointers.
Did you use the property of "the order of elements can be changed"?
What happens when the elements to remove are rare?

public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
    if (nums.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    int anchor = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // if target found, continue moving
        // else set value at anchor as current value, anchor++
        if (nums[i] != val) {
            nums[anchor] = nums[i];
            anchor++;
        }
    }
    // anchor increments when non_target value presents
    // so anchor = number of non_target values
    return anchor;
}
