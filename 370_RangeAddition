Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Example:

Given:

    length = 5,
    updates = [
        [1,  3,  2],
        [2,  4,  3],
        [0,  2, -2]
    ]

Output:

    [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
Explanation:

Initial state:
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
[ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]

After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
[ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]

After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
[-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]
Hint:

Thinking of using advanced data structures? You are thinking it too complicated.
For each update operation, do you really need to update all elements between i and j?
Update only the first and end element is sufficient.
The optimal time complexity is O(k + n) and uses O(1) extra space.


public int[] getModifiedArray(int length, int[][] updates) {
    if (length == 0) {
        return new int[0];
    }
    int[] output = new int[length];
    for (int[] op : updates) {
        int start = op[0];
        int end = op[1];
        int incr = op[2];
        output[start] += incr;
        if (end + 1 < length) {
            output[end + 1] -= incr;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
        output[i] += output[i-1];
    }
    return output;
}
